# DSLink SDK for .NET [![Build Status](https://ablcode.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/cf61073a-00ed-4166-9f78-170aba3120a5/255/badge)]
## Getting Started
This DSLink library for .NET targets .NET Standard, which supports .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono, as well as Xamarin!
It is currently being overhauled to target the broadest number of platforms, with the least amount of code and additional dependencies as possible.

### NuGet Repository
After the major code overhaul, we will be pushing our library to the official NuGet repositories.
